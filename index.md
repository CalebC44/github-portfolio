Challenge: What problem was this built to solve?

Tools Used: What specific tools/libraries did you use (e.g., Ansible, Python's requests library, specific Nginx modules)?

Result/Outcome: What did you learn? How successful was the deployment? Quantify the result if possible (e.g., "Reduced deployment time from 2 hours to 5 minutes," or "Successfully identified 5 common subdomain enumeration techniques").

### ðŸ”¹ Automated Reconnaissance Tool
Created a Python script that takes a domain name as input and automatically performs basic reconnaissance.
