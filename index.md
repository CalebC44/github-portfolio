Tools Used: Apache, Nginx, Graylogger, 

Result/Outcome: What did you learn? How successful was the deployment? Quantify the result if possible (e.g., "Reduced deployment time from 2 hours to 5 minutes," or "Successfully identified 5 common subdomain enumeration techniques").

### ðŸ”¹ Automated Reconnaissance Tool
Created a lightweight, modular reconnaissance utility written in Python, that takes a domain or an IP as input and returns an overview of the basic information.
