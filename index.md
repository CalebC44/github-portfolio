**[View the code on GitHub](https://github.com/calebc44/your-repo-name)** | **[Read the Blog Series (Part 1-3)](https://calebc44.github.io/github-portfolio/blog-post-1)**

Challenge: What problem was this built to solve?

Tools Used: What specific tools/libraries did you use (e.g., Ansible, Python's requests library, specific Nginx modules)?

Result/Outcome: What did you learn? How successful was the deployment? Quantify the result if possible (e.g., "Reduced deployment time from 2 hours to 5 minutes," or "Successfully identified 5 common subdomain enumeration techniques").

### ðŸ”¹ Automated Reconnaissance Tool
Created a lightweight, modular reconnaissance utility written in Python, that takes a domain or an IP as input and returns an overview of the basic information.
