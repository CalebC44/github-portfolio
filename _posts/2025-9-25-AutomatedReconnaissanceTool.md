### The Idea
This tool was developed to be one of my first projects in this portfolio. It is a simple tool that taks in a domain name and cheks among websites such as VirusTotal and Shdoan to see if it is malaicous. 


### The steps taken
Started out by figuring out how to run BASH commands in a python script. After secsfully implenting that the next step was to get user input. 

Once we got user input I found the commands I wanted to use whois and lslookup. Inputing those commands and cleaniing up the out you get basic information about the website.


###Automated Reconnaissance Tool:

- Goal: Create a Python or PowerShell script that takes a domain name as input and automatically performs basic reconnaissance.

- What it shows: Your ability to use APIs (like VirusTotal or Shodan) and command-line tools (like whois or nslookup) within a script.

- Skills Demonstrated: Python scripting, OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence), API integration.
